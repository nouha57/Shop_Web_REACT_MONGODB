#A simple BookStore website

This website has 3 screens :
* Home Screen 
* Product Details Screen 
* Cart Screen 

( i'm planning on adding a signin and a register screens ) 

This Project was made using :

FRONTEND : React 
BACKEND : MongoDB Express and node js 

Dependencies :
    "axios": "^0.21.1",
    "cors": "^2.8.5",
    "dotenv": "^8.2.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mongodb": "^3.6.8",
    "mongoose": "^5.12.10"
    
    
To get started :
 - clone this repo locally
 - in the root folder : npm install -> npm start 
 - in the backend folder ( to connect to mongo database and start the server ) :
 You have to first create a database in mongo compass ( that's the method i chose, there are pthers ofc ) then create a collection ( products ) then copy/paste the sample data that i provided in products.json file
 
in terminal ( root folder ) : 

[ if u dont have them already ]

  npm install express
  npm install nodemon -D ( so we don't have to refresh the server every time ) 
  npm install mongodb 

cd frontend : npm install -> npm start
